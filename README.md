# Best Practice

## Notes

* Any time you copy-paste code, you should be looking for a way to simplify or make a variable.

* function names should be verbs and descriptive of what task they perform.

* name things explicitly

* don't ever make buttons that just say "Next"
  * be descriptive so the user knows what will happen when the button is pressed

* seek feedback from people in target group, but not involed in the group or project

* use Target in the console to find the id

* DRY coding - don't repeat yourself
