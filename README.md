# Best Practice and Class Notes

* Any time you copy-paste code, you should be looking for a way to simplify or make a variable.

* function names should be verbs and descriptive of what task they perform.

* name things explicitly

* don't ever make buttons that just say "Next"
  * be descriptive so the user knows what will happen when the button is pressed

* seek feedback from people in target group, but not involed in the group or project

* use Target in the console to find the id


## Project planning resources:

* [moqups](https://moqups.com/) - Online Mockup, Wireframe & UI Prototyping Tool
* [figma](https://www.figma.com/) - a cloud-based design tool that is similar to Sketch in functionality and features, but with big differences that make Figma better for team collaboration
* [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - A wire framing tool that looks terrible. On purpose. Stitch together basic elements, but donâ€™t fixate on colors or copy
* [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) - free stock images that look nice and not, well, stock.
* [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/browser/latest/1) - color palette generator.
* [FontPair.co](https://fontpair.co/) - suggested pairings of Google Fonts

* Icons [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - font and icon toolkit based on CSS and LESS.
* Icons [thenounproject](https://thenounproject.com/) - icon library
* Icons [FlatIcon](https://www.flaticon.com/) - icon library grouped into packs

* event listener tester in console:

```javascript
const winners = () => {
    document.getElementById('all').addEventListener('click', (e) => {
        console.log(e);
    });
}
winners();
```

replace 'all' with the id of the item you want to test
