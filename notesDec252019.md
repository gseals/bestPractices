- if a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses
  - ex: const example = (
    <a href="url">
      <h1>
        Click here
      </h1>
    </a>
  );

- a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element: the first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element

- in JSX, for tags that are self-closing, such as <br /> and <img />, you must include the closing slash to signify the tag is closed

- writing JS in JSX requires curly brackets:
  - <h1>2 + 3</h1> yields 2 + 3
  - <h1>{2 + 3}</h1> yields 5

- accessing variables within JSX also uses curly brackets.

- an event listener's name should be something like onClick or onMouseOver

- an event's value should be a function

- valid [events](https://reactjs.org/docs/events.html#supported-events) in JSX

- if statements do not work when injected into JSX

- { age > 15 && <h1>Taco</h1> } says that when a number over 15 returns, the <h1> will run

- the 'key' attribute is similar to 'id'
  - A list needs keys if either of the following are true:

  * The list-items have memory from one render to the next. For instance, when a to-do list renders, each item must “remember” whether it was checked off. The items shouldn’t get amnesia when they render.

  * A list’s order might be shuffled. For instance, a list of search results might be shuffled from one render to the next.

  - If neither of these conditions are true, then you don’t have to worry about keys. If you aren’t sure then it never hurts to use them!

- you can use an 'i' in map to create a unique key
  - const example = tests.map((test, i) =>
  <li key={'test_' + i}>{test}</li>
);

- [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#react.createelement) documentation

- you can write React code without JSX. Example:
  - const h1 = <h1>Hello world</h1>; can be written as:
  const h1 = React.createElement(
  "h1",
  null,
  "Hello, world"
);

- React Components: a component is a reusable piece of code whose job, generally, is to render HTML

- the import React from 'react' line creates a new variable whose name is React and value is a specific imported JavaScript object that contains methods required to run React. The object is the React library

- every component must come from a component class. a component class is like a factory that creates components.

- the body comes within the curly braces that follow the opening curly braces; The body will act as a set of instructions, explaining to your component class how it should build a React component.

- There is only one property that you have to include in your instructions: a render method
  - a render method must contain a return statement. generally, the return statement returns a JSX expression

- class MyComponent extends React.Component
  is a class
  <MyComponent />
  is a component
