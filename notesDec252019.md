- if a JSX expression takes up more than one line, then you must wrap the multi-line JSX expression in parentheses
  - ex: const example = (
    <a href="url">
      <h1>
        Click here
      </h1>
    </a>
  );

- a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element: the first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element
