proptypes are like stencils for properties that you are bringing in

remember to name things explicitly so that developers who come behind you know what is going on

proptypes is like a contract between those who wrote the function and those using the function

you can build react apps with props and no proptypes

proptypes are the linter for props

proptypes are much more for large scale applications

pascal case should be capitalized on the first letter:
class _______ extends
import
export
