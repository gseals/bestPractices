for each component, you will also create a directory

App.js is the whole main thing that will be printed?

function is something that you call and it performs a singular operation each time\

class can have multiple funcitons that it calls and also houses multiple properties. like a car, each is made up of many parts

you can do a lot more with a class than you can with func

react has standard classes that come with built in functions

render() is a react word that comes with built in stuff

state for a react app is the source of all of your information

state is where you manage all of the data; you don't need a state for each?

react developer thing: capitalize each word and not camelCase

in exports, don't use the squiggly lines because the squigglies create an object 

props take something from state and pass it down to a child component

a component has state; a compenent is given props

redner and componentDidMount are lifecycle methods

map for react. map goes over an array of things and returns out; forEach has to be saved to a different array and then interacted with

prop-types are similar to interfaces in the back end so get used to prop types here

capitalize PropTypes in the import but not in the component

propdrilling means sending a function to where it needs to be without using it along the way

state
componentDidMount()
setState()
render()

will not use componentWillUnmount very often

class is like car because it has properties and methods (like drive or get oil changed)
